        <p>Dear Nithya, <br><br>
        On this special day, I just want to say how grateful I am to have you as my friend. From our countless memories to the little moments we’ve shared, every second spent with you is a treasure. 
        We’ve laughed together, cried together, and grown together. You are not just my friend; you are my sister by heart. I’m so lucky to have someone like you in my life.
        Here’s to many more years of friendship, love, and unforgettable moments! <br><br> 
        With love,<br>
        Your forever friend, Anitha ❤️</p>
